----------------------------

- Fixed typo in setup.py.in

- Added packaging for rhel6

- Changed copyright

- Prevent freeing IDMEF message value on idmef_message_get_string()
  idmef_message_get_string() used to free the value within the IDMEF
  message, because prelude_string_get_string_released() was used. As
  a result, further idmef_message_get_string() on the same IDMEF path
  where returning null value.

- C++ compilation fixes
  Include idmef-data.h, required for idmef_data_t declaration.

  When trying to insert a message containing no alert/heartbeat,
  the database would remain locked since preludedb_transaction_abort()
  was not called.

------------------------------------

- Fixed #494 : Prelude Correlator not stopping

- Changed Copyright

- Added packaging for rhel6

- Ability to specify an input IDMEF criteria

  There is now a [general] configuration section in prelude-correlator.conf
  allowing to specify a criteria option that use an IDMEF criteria parameter
  as an argument.
    
  Using this option, it is possible to specify an input filter for events
  to be processed by the correlator.
    
  Additionally, always use an IDMEFCriteria to check whether the input
  event is an alert, in place of manually retrieving alert.create_time.

- Fixed some typo

- Implement Context time merging capability
    
  Introduced time merging capability within Prelude-Correlator:
  as of now, correlation contexts are associated with the time of the
  triggering IDMEF event.
    
  When searching for a matching context, an existing context will only be
  returned in case the specified search time match the time windows of an
  existing context.
    
  This mean that when receiving a burst of events, the time carried with
  events is directly taken into account : separate instances exists for
  the same Context associated with events received at a different time.
    
  Additionally, context can be merged if more than one context time windows
  overlap.
