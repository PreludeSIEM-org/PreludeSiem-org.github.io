Prelude OSS 1.2.5
=================


2014-07-07, libprelude-1.2.5
----------------------------

- Various improvements

    - Improved error handling

    - In high level language, return an empty list if the path is ambiguous

    - Allow NULL idmef_value_t in list

        When retrieving value from a path, like alert.source(*).node.address(*).address,
        we also want to return undefined values, so that the returned list conforms
        to the number of item/index in the retrieved path.

    - Improved idmef_path_set() implementation

        It is now possible to set undefined elements, or override them.
        Additionally, append and prepend operation is now much faster.

    - Map idmef_value_type_id_t to a C++ enumeration

    - Provide __hash__ function for IDMEFValue class
      This allow Python sets() operation on IDMEFValue instance.

    - Explicitly activate thread support

    - Comparison operator support for IDMEFValue()

        Allow to directly compare two values together,
        without callingÂ the IDMEFValue.Match() method.
        Add support of the Python "in" operator (item in valuelist).

    - New prelude_list_splice() / prelude_list_splice_tail() function

    - Add missing PRELUDE_SCN* definition

    - Improve AdditionalData type checking

    - Prelude-Timer optimisation

- Corrections

    - Various string conversion fixes

    - Fix leak for all methods returning an idmef_value_type_id_t

    - Fix float value corruption when writing to a prelude_message

    - Fix high level bindings ambiguity on IDMEFPath.Set() and IDMEF.Set() methods

    - NTP timestamps were not correctly printed

    - Corrected IDMEF Clone() method

    - Fix idmef-message-helper units tests

- Compilation fixes

    - Various compilation warning fixes

    - Ruby high level bindings compilation fixes
      Fixed #513: make the Ruby binding code compatible with Ruby 1.9

    - Update to latest GnuTLS API
      Fix compilation if GnuTLS-Extra is not available

    - Fix Perl high level bindings compilation

    - Fixed #386: build failure with libtool 2.4

    - Fix configure script generation, and update GnuLib code


2014-07-07, libpreludedb-1.2.5
------------------------------

- Use new libprelude PRELUDE_SCN* definition

- Handle NULL input on preludedb_sql_escape_fast() and preludedb_sql_escape_binary()

- Fix AdditionalData insertion/retrieval

- Use PQescapeStringConn() in place of PQescapeString() when available

- Fix warnings and error on PostgreSQL ByteA insertion

    Use the E'%s' ByteA insertion method with our own escaping function,
    since this method is not compatible with PQescapeByteaConn().

- Improve sscanf() error check

- Remove rhel6 packaging

- Move Python command to a Python specific Makefile, filename fixes

- Fix compile warnings

- Fix configure script generation, and update GnuLib code

    Modify configure.in to fit latest autoconf / automake change.
    Configure script generation and make distcheck now work again.
    Update GnuLib code.
    Update various autoconf macros, and gtk-doc build files.


2014-07-07, prelude-correlator-1.2.5
------------------------------------

- Improved exception handling

- Support IDMEF Alert merge, to avoid CorrelationAlert listing
  the same source multiple times

- Allow pluginmanager API to be used with multiple entrypoints

    A Prelude-Correlator plugin may now use the pluginmanager API with
    their own entrypoint to load their own sub-plugins.

- Allow plugin to specify a list of conflicting plugins

    Using this interface, a plugin can now provide a list of other plugins
    that conflict with him, and that shouldn't be loaded.
    Additionally, provide a way for the user to force loading of a plugin
    that was disabled because of a conflict (using enable = force in the
    configuration section for the plugin).

- Add autoload attribute to the generic Plugin class

    This attribute controls whether PluginManager() will directly load a given
    plugin or only references the plugin class for later loading. Default behavior
    is to load the plugins.

- Various timer improvements

- Add an option to read IDMEF input from file,
  within the given offset / limit

- Add a stats() function which can be used by a plugin
  to provide statistics printing

- Implement GetAdditionalDataByMeaning() method

- Always retrieve the current time when no argument is supplied

- Add --disabledl option to setup.py sdist
  Downloading Spamhaus database need real user-agent, using Mozilla 5

- Logging fixes, using Python logging API

- Add the ability to set debug log level

- Updated dshield.dat, spamhaus_drop.dat

- Removed rhel6 packaging


2014-07-07, prelude-lml-1.2.5
-----------------------------

- Improve debugging output

- Initial TCP/TCP-TLS support

    * TCP server support has been added and can be activated using the
    tcp-server option, the default port is 514.

    * TCP-TLS server support has been added and can be activated using the
    "tcp-tls-server" option, the defaut port is 6514. The system support
    anonymous authentication using the (anon-(EC)DH) key exchange protocol as
    well as x509 authentication, which might be used with or without client
    certificate verification ("tls-verify option"). Certificate verification
    may include fingerprint (MD5 or SHA1) and/or name verification with the
    use of the "tls-trusted-fingerprint" and "tls-trusted-name" option.

    Multiple TCP(/TLS) server might be configured, listening on different ports
    with different options.
