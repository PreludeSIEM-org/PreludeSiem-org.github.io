.SH DESCRIPTION
In order for a sensor to communicate with a 'prelude-manager', it needs to be registered. Registration involves several steps:
 - Allocating an unique identity for the sensor
 - Creating directory to be used by the sensor (example: failover purpose)
 - Registering to a remote 'prelude-manager': get a signed X509 certificate that will allows communication between sensor and manager using the specified permissions. 

All these informations are stored in a sensor 'profile'. 

A sensor profile is identified by its name. When a sensor is started, it will try to load a profile of the same name as the program itself, that is, if your sensor is named "prelude-lml", the sensor will try to load a profile named "prelude-lml". 

The name of the profile can be overriden using the '--prelude --profile name_of_my_profile' command line option. We provide the ability of defining the profile name so that you can have several instances of one sensor running with different permissions, which require different profiles. 

Note that profile are not specific to sensor, but are used in all programs of the Prelude suite (sensors, managers, etc).

If you are not sure which permission your sensor should get, just start the sensor, which should then provide you with the prelude-adduser options to use for registering it.

.SH OPTIONS

.B <profile name>
is the default name of the sensor you are installing or your own defined name.

If you start your sensor without it being registered, it should show you a warning including the default profile name on how to register the sensor. 

.B <requested permission>
is the permission your sensor needs. It is composed of the kind of permission (idmef or admin) and read and/or write (r and/or w). Usually, a sensor will need permission for writing IDMEF to a manager, and reading administrative command sent to it. That is : "idmef:w admin:r".

.B <manager address>
is the address of the prelude-manager you wish to register. this can either be its IP address or its hostname name. If you made a local installation, you can write localhost there to connect threw unix socket.

Remember to use the correct uid/gid when registering your sensor. For instance, if you want to register snort (running with snort euid / egid), use --uid snort --gid snort. 

.TP 5
.B add <analyzer profile>
Setup a new sensor user.

.B --uid=UID
UID or user to use to setup sensor files

.B --gid=GID
GID or group to use to setup sensor files
.TP


.B chown <analyzer profile>
Change analyzer owner.

.B --uid=UID
UID or user to use to setup sensor files.

.B --gid=GID
GID or group to use to setup sensor files.
.TP


.B del <analyzer profile>
The delete command will remove the sensor files created through "add" command. Once this is done, the analyzer can't be used unless "register" or "add" is called again.
.TP


.B rename <analyzer profile> <analyzer profile>
Rename an existing analyzer.
.TP


.B register <profile name> <wanted permission> <registration-server address>
Register an analyzer.

Register both "add" the analyzer basic setup if needed
and will also configure communication of this analyzer with a
receiving analyzer (like a Manager) through the specified registration-server.

.B --uid=UID
UID or user to use to setup analyzer files.

.B --gid=GID
GID or group to use to setup analyzer files.

.B --passwd=PASSWD
Use provided password instead of prompting it.

.B --passwd-file=-|FILE
Read password from file instead of prompting it (- for stdin).
.TP


.B registration-server <profile name>

Start a registration server that will be used to register sensors.
This is used in order to register 'sending' analyzer to 'receiving'
analyzer. <profile name> should be set to the profile name of the
'receiving' analyzer, the one where 'sending' analyzer will register to.

.B --uid=UID
UID or user to use to setup 'receiving' analyzer files.

.B --gid=GID
GID or group to use to setup 'receiving' analyzer files.

.B --prompt
Prompt for a password instead of auto generating it.

.B --passwd=PASSWD
Use provided password instead of auto generating it.

.B --passwd-file=-|FILE
Read password from file instead of auto generating it (- for stdin).

.B --keepalive
Register analyzer in an infinite loop.

.B --no-confirm
Do not ask for confirmation on sensor registration.

.B --listen
Address to listen on for registration request (default is any:5553).
.TP

.B revoke <profile name>
Revoke access to <profile> for the given analyzerID.

.B --uid=UID
UID or user to use to setup analyzer files.

.B --gid=GID
GID to group to use to setup analyzer files.
.TP

.B --help
Print help
